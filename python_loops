Repeating code over and over again

#Defining a for loop with range

for i in range(1,10):

#Defining for loop with collections

col=['aditya','loves','shama']
for i in col:
    print i
'''

#for loop with break,continue & if
'''
for i in range(2,10):
    #if(i==6): break #break will terminate from the loop once the condition matches and omits other execution
    if(i%2==0): continue #continue will skip the execution when it encounters the condition
    print i
'''

#for loop with enumerate function which returns the index of the object in either list or collection
d=['aditya','loves','shama']
for i,j in enumerate(d):
    print i,j

#there is a difference between printing i,j in reference to emumerate
