import calendar

#Creata a plain text calendar

#Defining Sunday as first day of the month
#c = calendar.TextCalendar(calendar.SUNDAY)

#defining the calendar month
#str = c.formatmonth(2016,10,0,0)
#print str

#Create HTML Calendar
#c = calendar.HTMLCalendar(calendar.SUNDAY)

#str = c.formatmonth(2016,10)
#print str

#loop over the days of a month
#print "Iterate over Month Days:"
#for i in c.itermonthdays(2016,10):
 #   print i
#Zeros in o/p points to the days of a week which belongs to another month


#Calendar provides useful utilities for the given locale,
#such as name of months, days in both full & abbrivated forms

#print "Month Name:"
#for i in calendar.month_name:
  #  print i

#print "\nDay Name:"
#for j in calendar.day_name:
    #print j
 #   print  first friday of a week in a month where the employee meets

for m in range(1,13):
    cal=calendar.monthcalendar(2016,m) #Iterate over all the months in an Year
    weekone = cal[0] # Holds 1st week of the month
    weektwo = cal[1] # Holds 2nd Week of the month

    if weekone[calendar.FRIDAY] != 0:
        #here 0 represents day belongs to another month
        meetday = weekone[calendar.FRIDAY]
    else :
        meetday = weektwo[calendar.FRIDAY]

    print "%10s %2d" % (calendar.month_name[m],meetday)
